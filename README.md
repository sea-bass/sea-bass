### Hi everyone 👋

I'm a robotics engineer and applied scientist working at the [Robotics and AI (RAI) Institute](https://rai-inst.com/), focusing on composition of learned skills for robust, long-horizon, contact rich manipulation tasks.

Previously, I was at:
* (2022-2024) [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai) working on [MoveIt Pro](https://picknik.ai/pro/) for robot behavior and planning in ROS 2.
* (2021-2022) [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) working on behaviors for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) warehouse robot.
* (2020-2021) The [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), as a research software engineer.
* (2011-2019) [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/), where I supported student competitions such as [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) and made robotics educational content with MATLAB and Simulink.
* (2006-2011) Cornell University, B.S. + M.S. Mechanical Engineering.

On my spare time, I like to teach things related to robotics, AI, and software development.

I am passionate about open-source robotics software and am an active member of the Robot Operating System (ROS) community, with a focus on education and community building.
Some highlights include:
* Creator of [PyRoboSim](https://github.com/sea-bass/pyrobosim), [RoboPlan](https://github.com/open-planning/roboplan), and [TurtleBot Behavior Demos](https://github.com/sea-bass/turtlebot3_behavior_demos).
* Currently helping maintain [PyTrees](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees), and formerly have helped with [rosbridge](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite) and [MoveIt 2](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2).
* Co-moderator of the [ROS Deliberation Community Group](https://github.com/ros-wg-delib).
* Mentor for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (2023-2024) and [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/) (2025).
* Reviewer for the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/): [![JOSS Reviews](https://joss.theoj.org/badges/reviewed_by/@sea-bass)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@sea-bass)
