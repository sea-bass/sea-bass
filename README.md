### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotics engineer and applied scientist working at the [Robotics and AI (RAI) Institute](https://rai-inst.com/), focusing on task and motion planning with learned skills for long-horizon, contact rich manipulation tasks.

Previously, I was at:
* (2022-2024) [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai) working on [MoveIt Pro](https://picknik.ai/pro/) for robot behavior and planning in ROS 2. I also helped out as a [MoveIt maintainer](https://moveit.ai/about/).
* (2021-2022) [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) working on behaviors for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) warehouse robot.
* (2020-2021) The [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), as a research software engineer.
* (2017-2019) [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/), where I supported student competitions such as [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) and made robotics educational content with MATLAB and Simulink.

On my spare time, I like to teach things related to robotics, AI, and software development.
