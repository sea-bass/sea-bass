### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotics engineer currently taking a short break.

Previously, I was at:
* (2022-2024) [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai) working on [MoveIt Pro](https://picknik.ai/pro/) for robot behavior and planning in the ROS ecosystem.
* (2021-2022) [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) working on behaviors for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) warehouse robot.
* (2020-2021) The [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
* (2017-2019) [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/), where I supported student competitions such as [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/). I still remain somewhat involved through initiatives like [RoboCup@Home Education](https://www.robocupathomeedu.org/).

On my spare time, I like to teach things related to robotics, AI, and software development.
