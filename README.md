### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotics engineer currently working in the [Robust Robotics Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

I also like to teach things related to robotics, AI, and software development. Learn more at [https://roboticseabass.com/](https://roboticseabass.com/).
